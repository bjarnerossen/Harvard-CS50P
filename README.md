# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

### Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.

All exercises performed in CS50 Python, with 100%, in 2022. Learned about functions, arguments, and return values; variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. How to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice.
